Project Overview

This decentralized application (DApp) enables users to donate to social causes in Cali using stablecoins. The application is designed to support any EVM-compatible network and is currently deployed on the Polygon Amoy Testnet.

Key Features

Multi-Network Compatibility: Works on any EVM-compatible network.

Gasless Transactions: Implements account abstraction via ERC-4337 and a paymaster mechanism.

User-Friendly Wallet Connection: Integrates with RainbowKit for seamless authentication.

Modern Tech Stack: Built using Next.js and Scaffold-ETH for rapid development and modularity.

Deliverables

GitHub Repository: Contains structured commits and follows Git flow best practices.

Live DApp Deployment: Hosted on Vercel for easy access.

Verified Smart Contract: Deployed and verified on Polygon Amoy Testnet.
